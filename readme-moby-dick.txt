# Moby-Dick the RPG

This is a pre-alpha version of Moby-Dick the RPG. Actually it's also mixed in with ren'py files because idk I'm just testing things out right now. I'm not even sure I should use ren'py for it. That may end up being more trouble than it's worth...

Note: I do not expect this commit of this repo, or really this repo at all, to survive into the future. It has a bunch of binary files I've included here just for reproducibility reasons.

Future possibility: there are some public domain illustrated versions of moby dick we can maybe use the character art of. see, for example: https://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Moby_Dick_p91_illustration.jpg and https://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Moby_Dick_p510_illustration.jpg

## Roadmap

Moby Dick planning document (epic)

Total time: maybe 30+50+50 = 130 ; 130 * 2 (hofstadter's constant) = 260 ; 260/8 = 32.5 man-days? If two guys work one solid day a week, that would be 16.25 weeks, or four months. Well, hard to say.

Vertical slice (demo) time: maybe, 5 characters 7 poses, a couple of rpg battles, and up through chapter 9, maybe (Jonah could be the first boat mechanics).

Ok, so, there are three components to Moby Dick the RPG (hence: M) : text, gameplay, and art.

Technical backend: I guess this is renpy for now. Could still pivot. Or just stay the course.

Text: it would take probably 30 hours to typeset all of M into renpy, assuming you also add various textual details (occasionally, the book has formatting), and also internal character tags. Most of it is just breaking on paragraphs, though. It's like 200,000 words.

Gameplay: turn-based RPG system. Kind of a combat puzzle for each thing. No dynamic carry-over progress, so you can do it like a book (I can see the case against this). This probably would not need additional art, except for maybe battle backgrounds) so it would just be the difficulty of programming it... maybe 50 hours? It also has to be designed. Fun, you might say. There might not be, strictly speaking, enough combat in the story, so maybe add boat mechanics? That's strategic like rpg, & can be turn-based.

Art:
Main characters (5 poses): could get away with maybe 3 of these tbh
Side character (1 pose): there are like 30 of these tbh.
Settings (backdrop): town (two towns), ship (two ships (The pequod is covered in whale ivory, so it looks different than every other ship, which look kinda the same)
Cutaways: need at least one whale shot, although this could be simply the whale character art. And then you could have up to 200 cutaway images, depending on how cool you are.
Time estimate: I don't know

Marketing: I don't know.

Music: I guess the optimal thing to do would be have a high-quality original soundtrack (perhaps orchestral, metal, nautical, or electronica). But there's probably enough public domain music that is good enough to just use that.
Doesn't fit either of those criteria, but I kind of like https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5Jfup7dHDg, "Dangerous A" by Mladen Franko from DRAMATIC WORKSHOP VOL. 5: ADVENTURES, Because of a joke they made in  SpongeBob SquarePants, episode “Clams”, that I believe is a reference to Jaws.

Moby Dick the rpg additional features

1. Anime women mode (not lewd. Cute tho). And 
Public-domain illustration mode. normally it will just be original illustration mode

2. You can actually input other names for Ishmael &co

3. Wacky new-game plus? (Maybe make this a sequel or DLC)

4. Full 3d animated cutscenes (do not actually do this)

5. Have an entire audio book of M optionally play in the background ( perhaps: https://librivox.org/moby-dick-by-herman-melville/ )

## To-Dos

1. Get main menu > VN > combat > VN > game complete flow working

## Dumb Ideas

visual novel toggle (just changes game name on title screen and removes even the option to have battles)

anime mode is actually a scalar, and at the highest level, the buttons are also anime girls. all the dialogue also then becomes japanese, but also it's just English phonetically written in katakana.

idle navigating a boat while the text goes by?
